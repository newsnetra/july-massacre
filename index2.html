        <article>
            <div class="article-text">

                <p><span class="dropcap">T</span>wo burkha-clad women were frantically running through the fish market
                    behind East West
                    University. “A man told us to take this route to get to Farazy hospital [in Rampura from Merul
                    Badda] because there’s heavy gunfire, the Rampura bridge is inaccessible,” says Selina Begum,
                    Selim Talukdar’s mother.</p>

                <p>On July 18th, 2024, around the time of Zuhr Azan, Selina sprinted out of her home with her
                    daughter. She had just received a call from her son’s phone. “‘He has been shot,’ a stranger
                    informed me,” recalls Selina. Protesters, the police, armed Awami League cadres and violence
                    swarmed the streets.</p>
                <p>By the time Selina reached the hospital, Selim’s body had already left. “The doctor there said
                    he’s in critical condition. They sent him to a government hospital,” she says.</p>
                <p>Mugda, it must be, Selina deduced. “My daughter was first taken in to see my son. She was asked
                    if she’s strong,” says Selina.</p>
                <p>Emotional restraint was a critical need, it seems. In a few moments, Selina was asked to show it.
                    Selina braced for impact, but nothing could have really prepared her.</p>
                <p>Selim’s body was twitching, but he was unconscious. The spasms were involuntary, perhaps like a
                    fish out of water. Selim incurred 75 pellet wounds across his upper torso, including his head.
                </p>
                <p>After 12 days at the ICU at a private hospital in the capital, where Selina had to sign a
                    statement declaring that Selim was not taking part in the student protests, her only son died.
                </p>
                <p>Md Selim Talukder, who was shot multiple times by the police at close range, is among the scores
                    of victims of a three-week-long massacre in Bangladesh perpetrated by the then-ruling
                    government, the Awami League.</p>
                <p>What started as a student protest demanding reforms to the quota-based government job recruitment
                    system turned into a bloody anti-government movement after the then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina
                    failed to quell the protests with unlawful use of force, violence and intimidation tactics.</p>
                <p>Hasina fled to India on August 5th, 2024. An interim government succeeded her government.</p>



                <h2>Shoot first, aim later</h2>
                <p>Our analysis — verified by accounts from victims’ families and news reports — suggests that half of
                    the victims out of 705 did not actively participate in the protests. They were pedestrians,
                    onlookers, or they joined the victory march after learning of Hasina’s ousting, unaware of any
                    imminent attacks. Some of them were shot while returning home, some went out to buy food, some were
                    going to work, and some were even shot while on rooftops, balconies or inside their homes.</p>
                <p>It appears that the security forces and Awami League cadres did not spend much time discerning
                    between the protesters and pedestrians or onlookers.</p>
                <p>Human Rights Watch concluded in their report that the indiscriminate attacks on bystanders “appeared
                    to be part of a broader pattern.” According to the <a
                        href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2025/01/27/after-monsoon-revolution/roadmap-lasting-security-sector-reform-bangladesh">report</a>,
                    police shot at onlookers observing the scene from their homes, aiming to instil fear and convey a
                    message that people should not watch what was happening around them.</p>
                <p>Our findings indicate that 96.56% of the deaths caused by security forces or members of the Awami
                    League, or by both groups, were due to gunshots.</p>

            <div class="article-text">
                <p>All victims who died from fatal wounds during the curfew days — from July 20th to July 22nd — were
                    shot, according to their families and news reports. This indicates that the forces enforcing the
                    curfew openly used firearms. The pattern continued on the final days of the regime, on August 4th
                    and August 5th.</p>
                <p>Only a handful of victims died after being beaten or stabbed by Awami League-linked armed cadres. Two
                    victims died after an executive magistrate’s car rammed them in Sherpur, and two others were drowned
                    in Madaripur and Sylhet. The rest were gunned down.</p>
                <p>At least 272 victims actively joined the protests, according to their families and news reports. Most
                    of them were young. Generation Z (individuals born between 1997 and 2012) not only led the movement
                    but also paid the ultimate price in droves. Our analysis shows 61.31% of the victims were from
                    Generation Z, followed by millennials (29.16%).</p>
                <p>The youngest victim of the massacre was a four-year-old, and the oldest was in his seventies.</p>

                <h2>Killing fields</h2>
                <p>Taim and his two friends were inside a shuttered tea stall at Jatrabari. Around 12:30 pm — during a
                    brief recess in a nationwide curfew — the police dragged out Rahat, Taim’s friend and beat him
                    indiscriminately.</p>
                <p>Taim was dragged out, too, but he met a worse fate.</p>
                <p>“Run!” the police ordered. Taim and his friends listened. But, within a few moments, he fell. The
                    police shot Taim from the back.</p>
                <p>Rahat bends over to drag Taim’s body, but the rubber bullets continue to rain. The video clip, which
                    eventually went viral on social media from the July-August uprising, captured Taim’s limp body and
                    Rahat’s struggle to move the body away from the police.</p>
                <p>It was then that Zakir Hossain, an official attached to Jatrabari Police Station, approached with his
                    shotgun, targeting Taim’s chest and shot him.</p>

                    division of Dhaka Metropolitan Police, followed by Uttara, Mirpur and Gulshan divisions. Wari
                    comprises the Jatrabari and Kadamtali police stations. The officials of these stations are accused
                    of killing at least 107 victims.</p>
                <p>As the July massacre unfolded, Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, saw the highest number of deaths, at

            <div class="article-text">

                <p>The violence was particularly indiscriminate on July 19th, 20th, and August 5th.</p>
                <p>According to our analysis, at least 325 victims died in the third week of July as the security forces
                    and the Awami League cracked down on the protesters. The attacks were intensified on July 18th, when
                    53 people suffered deadly injuries, and on the following day, the number rose by threefold.</p>
                <p>On the evening of July 19th, following around a hundred deaths and at least a dozen severely injured
                    protesters, the Hasina regime imposed a curfew with “shoot-at-sight” orders starting at midnight on
                    July 20th. The number of fatal injuries from bullet wounds significantly declined in the following
                    days; however, they surged again on August 4th when the armed cadres of the Awami League became
                    particularly active following a directive from the party to its members to “gather” in every ward,
                    district, and city.</p>


                <p>Numerous photographs and videos from that day captured Awami League members parading in the streets
                    armed with military-grade weapons, sharp machetes, and blunt objects. Notably, half of the victims
                    who suffered fatal injuries leading to their deaths were harmed by these Awami League members or
                    armed cadres backed by the party, allegedly killing 86.</p>

            <div class="article-text">
                <p>On August 5th, at least 268 people suffered fatal injuries; some died on that day, and others
                    succumbed to their injuries in the following months.</p>
                <h2>July 18: ‘The Core Committee’</h2>
                <p>All of the country’s chiefs of security forces and intelligence agencies comprised this ‘core’
                    committee, according to the UN’s human rights office’s report on the massacre, published in February
                    2025. It was headed by the then Home Minister, Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal.</p>
                <p>The committee met on July 18th for the first time and decided to engage the paramilitary force BGB,
                    which carries military-grade weapons used in wars. The high death toll in Wari and Narayanganj,
                    among other zones and districts, is linked to a strategic decision made by the then Awami League
                    government.</p>

                <p>Kamal ordered the security forces to clear the thousands of protesters who were blocking the
                    Dhaka-Chattogram highway (N1), the country’s economic lifeline, according to the OHCHR report.
                    Wari’s Jatrabari area is the gateway to the Dhaka-Chattogram highway, which passes through
                    Narayanganj’s Chittagong Road.</p>
                <p>Police and security forces became increasingly desperate to remove the protesters from the two areas
                    that sit on the highway. From July 19th to July 22nd, at least 72 individuals suffered fatal
                    injuries in these areas.</p>
                <p>According to our analysis, all but one of the victims who were shot in Narayanganj were shot in areas
                    adjacent to the highway. However, the actual numbers may be higher.</p>


                <p>Netra News obtained photographs of senior police officials visiting Jatrabari on July 22nd after the
                    ‘successful’ clearing operation. At least three of these officials — IGP Chowdhury Abdullah
                    Al-Mamun, RAB DG Harun Ar Rashid, and Special Branch Chief Monirul Islam — joined the Core Committee
                    meeting with the then Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal on July 18th.</p>
                <p>The following is the list of individuals who made up this committee: Former chief of police Chowdhury
                    Abdullah Al-Mamun; the BGB Director General, Major General A. K. M. Nazmul Hasan; the head of the
                    RAB, Harun-Ar-Rashid (under United States sanctions); Major General A. K. M. Aminul Haque, Director
                    General of Ansar and the Village Defence Party; the head of the DGFI, Major General Hamidul Haque;
                    the chief of the National Security Intelligence (NSI), Major General Hossain Al Morshed; Monirul
                    Islam, chief of the police’s Special Branch; and Ziaul Ahsan, the head of the NTMC.</p>
                <p>The UN report also claims that a general from the Bangladesh Army joined the committee from July
                    20th, shortly after the imposition of a nationwide curfew.</p>

                <h2>July 19: Enter BNP and Jamaat activists</h2>
                <p>In the state-sponsored massacre, 12.22% of the victims were members or activists of the BNP,
                    according to their families and news reports, while 2.13% were from Jamaat. However, both parties
                    claim higher figures.</p>
                <p>Netra News asked the family members of the victims and reviewed the news reports to ascertain whether
                    the victims were involved with any political party. Our findings indicate that 88 victims were
                    leaders or activists of the BNP or its affiliated organisations, while 15 victims were associated
                    with Jamaat or its affiliated groups.</p>
                <p>However, it is likely that many family members of the victims may not be aware of their political
                    affiliations, as they lived far away from them; hence, the number is not accurate and might not
                    capture the full extent of the parties’ loss during the protests.</p>

            <div class="article-text">
                <p>Even so, it provides a crucial pattern.</p>
                <p>Our analysis shows that, though a member of BNP’s student wing, Chhatra Dal, died on July 16th, the
                    party started losing its activists in large numbers from July 19th. It lost 25 of its activists and
                    leaders on the streets on that day, with two deaths on July 20th and three on July 21st, suggesting
                    that the party got involved with the movement on July 19th.</p>
                <p>BNP was heavily active on August 4th, and almost one-fifth of the victims of the day were party
                    leaders or activists. On the following day, the party lost 34 of its men.</p>
                <p>Jamaat lost three activists on July 19th, the highest in July, and ten on August 5th. At least one
                    member of Gana Sanghati Andolan, Gono Odhikar Parishad and Islami Andolan Bangladesh died, too,
                    during the protests.</p>

            <div class="article-text">

                <p>However, not everyone on the martyrs’ list belonging to these parties was active in the protest. Some
                    of them died while crossing the road or returning from work, according to our analysis based on
                    testimonies of family members and news reports.</p>
                <h2>Who were the perpetrators</h2>
                <p>Most of the victims died allegedly at the hands of the police, followed by the armed cadres of the
                    Awami League.</p>
                <p>Our tally — verified by victims’ families, witnesses and news reports — indicates that police
                    inflicted deadly injuries on at least 467 victims. The police were most brutal on July 19th and
                    August 5th. In 61 cases, police worked with the BGB to shoot at the protesters, and given the
                    complex nature of the situation, it has been extremely difficult for the witnesses and journalists
                    to ascertain whose shots took the lives of the victims.</p>

            <div class="article-text">

                <p>It is also likely that the witnesses might have used police interchangeably to describe the members
                    of the security forces in some cases.</p>
                <p>According to our analysis, at least 43 victims died as a result of coordinated attacks by the Awami
                    League and the police, and 27 more died at the hands of the BGB. In two instances, witnesses
                    reported that the army shot the victims. On August 4th, during a protest in Sherpur, a government
                    official's car struck and killed at least two protesters.</p>

                                <p>To comply with the official definition of martyrs, according to the “July Mass
                                    Uprising Martyrs’
                                    Families and Injured Students-Citizens Welfare and Rehabilitation Ordinance, 2025”,
                                    issued on June
                                    17th, 2025, in this analysis, we have considered only the victims who lost their
                                    lives in
                                    state-backed excesses by security forces and Awami League men. However, the list
                                    released by the
                                    government does not fully comply with its own ‘martyr’ criteria.</p>
                                <p>Netra News collected the list of victims from the gazette that mentioned 834 names,
                                    and reached out
                                    to the families to collect the location where the victims were injured, the cause of
                                    their deaths,
                                    the alleged perpetrators, their age and political affiliation. We verified the
                                    information from at
                                    least two news articles published in national and, in some cases, local newspapers.
                                </p>
                                <p>Of 834 victims’ families, 666 responded to our call. The remaining families either
                                    did not respond to
                                    our call, despite repeated attempts, or their numbers were found to be switched off.
                                    Five families
                                    of victims responded to our call but refused to share any information.</p>
                                <p>After collecting the information from the families, we looked for the victims’ names
                                    in the
                                    newspapers published during and after the massacre. We have found necessary and
                                    relevant information
                                    in several national and local dailies confirming 748 victims who suffered fatal
                                    injuries from July
                                    16th to August 5th and consequently died.</p>
                                <p>We have collected information about the victims whose family members could not be
                                    reached from at
                                    least two news reports. We also spoke with the protest mobilisers and witnesses from
                                    different areas
                                    to confirm the details of the clashes that led to their deaths.</p>
                                <p>Among these victims, 705 lost their lives due to the excesses of the security forces
                                    and members of
                                    the Awami League.</p>
                                <p>The rest of the victims (748-703=45) whose information was verified but not included
                                    in the analysis,
                                    died due to various reasons after Sheikh Hasina fled. The majority of them (44) were
                                    burnt in houses
                                    or hotels owned by Awami League leaders, and at least one of them was electrocuted.
                                </p>
                                <p>Regarding the remaining victims — 86 in total — Netra News was unable to gather
                                    sufficient
                                    information for analysis. This was primarily because their deaths were not
                                    adequately reported in
                                    major newspapers, and family members did not respond to our repeated calls.
                                    Additionally, in some of
                                    the cases, the surrounding circumstances of their deaths did not meet the criteria
                                    for being
                                    classified as massacre victims, or “martyrs.”</p>
                                <p>For example, we have found the names of police officials in the list as well, who
                                    were killed,
                                    according to their families and news reports, by protesters. We have found at least
                                    one victim in
                                    the list who was mistaken as Awami League and was killed by protesters, despite
                                    joining the
                                    protests.</p>
                                <p>Through news articles and interviews, we identified that six individuals on the list
                                    died of natural
                                    causes. Two others passed away due to injuries sustained on August 6th; one of them
                                    was killed while
                                    attempting to escape from prison.</p>
                                <p>Furthermore, four individuals listed were police officials.</p>
                                <blockquote>On July 1st, 2025, the interim government added 10 more names to the list of
                                    834 martyrs.
                                    However, Netra News was unable to reach the families after repeated calls.
                                </blockquote>
